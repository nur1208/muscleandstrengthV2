            protein per serving. This high-grade protein source
            provides 14 g of essential amino acids (EAAs), which
            includes 6 g of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs),

          <h4>UNDENATURED PROTEIN = MORE PROTEIN!</h4>
          <p>
            To ensure a higher yield, the protein found in APEX
            is processed at 4° Celsius. This purification process
            helps ensure that the protein and bioactive whey
            fractions in the formula stay intact. These bioactive
            whey fractions have their own unique biological
            properties to help support muscle repair and growth,
            digestive health, immunity, liver function and
            overall health.*
          </p>
          <p>
            With APEX Whey you’re getting high-quality protein
            that has not been denatured by heat, enzymes or acids
            and is easily assimilated by the body. If a protein
            has been subjected to harsh chemicals, excessive heat
            or enzymes, these whey fractions will not be present
            in the protein.*
