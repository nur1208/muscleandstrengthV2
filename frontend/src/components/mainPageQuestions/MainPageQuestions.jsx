            <h4>1. What is the best routine for the gym?</h4>
            <p>
              The best routine for the gym is one that is
              flexible with your schedule and you actually enjoy.
              These two factors will contribute greatly to your
              ability to be consistent with your workouts.
              Consistency with your workouts and progressing as
              you perform them is what will lead to results.
            </p>
            <p>
              That being said, there are plenty of great workout
              program styles one can do to build muscle, lose
              fat, or{" "}
              <a href="/expert-guides/strength">
                build strength
              </a>
              . The body composition goals (building muscle and
              losing fat) will be accomplished through similar
              style workouts combined with differing nutritional
              principles, while those looking for strength gains
              may need to focus on programs that are centered on
              the idea of specificity.
            </p>
            <p>
              To sum that statement up, if you want to change
              your body composition, you’ll want to train with
              volume. If you want to build strength, you’ll want
              a program that is strength specific for the lifts
              you want to improve such as the bench press, squat
              and deadlift.
            </p>
            <h4>2. What body parts to work on what days?</h4>
            <p>
              The answer to this question would assume that the
              person asking is referring to body part splits. In
              this case, the way you split your days likely won’t
              matter too much, as long as you work every body
              part throughout the week.
            </p>
            <p>
              There may be some benefit into ensuring you don’t
              hit chest and shoulders or legs and back on
              consecutive days, but if you do, it probably won’t
              be that big of an issue depending on your overall
              strength levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if you are looking to optimize your
              training by incorporating a{" "}
              <a href="/articles/boost-muscle-growth-high-frequency-training">
                higher training frequency
              </a>{" "}
              (hitting each muscle group more often throughout
              the week), you may want to look into pairing
              certain muscle groups on certain workout days.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most popular pairings are full body workouts,
              upper/lower workouts, push/pull workouts and
              push/pull/legs workouts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, the actual days you put your workouts on
              likely won’t make that much of a difference to the
              overall outcome of your training so long as you are
              consistent with your workouts and implement
              progressive overload (increasing the weight used)
              over time.
            </p>
            <h4>3. What should a beginner do at the gym?</h4>
            <p>
              The best thing a beginner can do at the gym is seek
              out the help of a trained professional to assist
              them with learning the proper form of each
              exercise. Practicing the basics and establishing a
              solid foundation in terms of form will help a
              beginner lifter remain injury free throughout their
              life.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are not in the position to hire a trained
              professional, you may want to proceed working out
              with some level of caution. The same recommendation
              of practicing the fundamentals still applies. Start
              off with light weight (the bar on barbell
              exercises) and record yourself performing
              exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the exercise recordings, compare your form
              with examples of proper form. Evaluate how you are
              moving and progress from there by either working on
              your form, or after you’ve mastered your form,
              adding weight.
            </p>
            <h4>
              4. What is the best workout routine for beginners?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The best workout routine for true beginners is
              rather subjective to what the beginner is
              comfortable doing and their understanding of how to
              perform exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their{" "}
              <a href="/articles/setting-goals">ultimate goal</a>{" "}
              will also play a huge factor as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally speaking though, beginners can start off
              performing anywhere between 2-4 workouts per week.
              These workouts can be either full body workouts or
              upper/lower workouts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workouts should focus on learning ideal
              movement patterns of fundamental lifts such as
              horizontal presses, vertical presses, horizontal
              pulls, vertical pulls, squats, hip hinges, and
              loaded carries.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are several beginner workout routines on
              Muscle &amp; Strength that can give beginners a
              template to start off with.

              5. What is the best workout schedule to build
              muscle?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The best workout schedule to build muscle is a
              workout schedule that you enjoy and can be
              consistent with.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to consistency, it would be beneficial
              to have a higher training frequency if the goal is
              to{" "}
              <a href="/expert-guides/muscle-building">
                build lean muscle mass
              </a>
              . You’ll want to hit each muscle group either
              directly or indirectly 2-3 times weekly to maximize
              muscle growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some great splits to look into would be full body
              workouts, upper/lower workouts, push/pull workouts
              and push/pull/legs workouts.
            </p>
            <h4>7. What are the 10 best exercises?</h4>
            <p>
              The best 10 exercises for someone might not be the
              best 10 exercise for another person. When selecting
              an exercise to use, it’s important to keep your own
              abilities and goals in mind. Some people might be
              able to perform an exercise with no pain at all,
              while that same exercise might cause another a lot
              of pain. If it hurts, don’t do it and find an
              alternative.
            </p>
            <p>
              That being said, there are certainly important
              movement patterns that everyone who is capable
              should try to train.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following exercises are my personal favorite 10
              exercises that would be fantastic to include in
              your workouts. However, like I said, you may need
              to substitute these with a variation that is better
              suited for your individual body type, training
              experience, and needs.

            <h4>7. How do I schedule my workout at the gym?</h4>
            <p>
              This all boils down to setting up and selecting
              workout programs that are both flexible and
              enjoyable. There is no perfect one way to set up
              training. It’s very subjective from person to
              person.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you only have 2 days where you’re able to make
              it to the gym, a full body workout makes sense. 3
              days? Full body makes sense, push/pull/legs can
              work as well if that is what you enjoy. The more
              days you have available, the more split and
              scheduling options you’ll have.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start off by figuring out how many and what days
              you can make it to the gym regularly. Then, look to
              schedule your training on those days. Find a
              workout that doesn’t require any more than that
              total training frequency. Then, look for something
              where if you miss a training day, you’re able to
              make it up throughout the week or already train
              that muscle more than once per week.
            </p>
            <h4>
              8. Can you gain 10 pounds of muscle in a month?
            </h4>
            <p>
              You can gain 10 pounds in a month. You can’t gain
              10 pounds of pure muscle in a month naturally.
            </p>
            <p>
              10 pounds in a month is likely during a lean
              bulking phase, especially for beginners. The muscle
              will grow fairly quickly, and if you’re coming off
              a fat loss phase, early weight gain will be from
              glycogen replenishing and being stored in the body.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your goal is to gain muscle, it’s better to take
              a slower approach. This will limit fat gain during
              your muscle building phases.
            </p>
            <h4>9. What is a good gym routine?</h4>
            <p>
              A good gym routine is one that you enjoy, works
              your muscles with the appropriate frequency and
              volume for your experience level, and that you can
              be consistent with.
            </p>
            <p>
              This can look very different from person to person.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exercise selection for a good gym routine will

              (push, pull, lunge, hip hinge, squat, and carry) in
              a way that you are comfortable performing them.
              There is a pain-free variation for nearly every
              body type who can healthily perform these
              movements.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good gym routine also focuses on progression.
              This means making the workouts more challenging in
              some way from week to week, or training phase to
              training phase as you get more advanced.
            </p>
            <h4>10. How much weight should a beginner lift?</h4>
            <p>
              The total amount of weight someone should use is
              going to be different from individual to
              individual, and also exercise to exercise for each
              individual. Depending on the program, it might vary
              from set to set of each exercise based on the rep
              scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
              The general recommendation would be to experiment.
              You want your sets to be hard and very near failure
              whenever it’s possible to train at such an
              intensity.
            </p>

              (like the fundamental ones listed above), aim to
              finish each set feeling as though you could’ve
              performed 1-3 more reps if pushed to your limit.

              leg extension or lateral raise) you can push
              yourself closer to complete failure.
            </p>
            <h4>11. How much cardio should a beginner do?</h4>
            <p>
              Cardio recommendations will be highly dependent on
              your overall goal. For most, it may not be even
              necessary to perform additional cardio. Focusing on
              progressing the weight used in your workouts and
              getting stronger over time will have a more
              beneficial impact on your body composition than
              cardio will.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those looking to be generally healthy, light
              cardio might be beneficial. Bouts of walking will
              go a long way to aiding with body composition,
              recovery, and your ability to handle life
              stressors.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those looking to{" "}
              <a href="/expert-guides/fat-loss">lose body fat</a>
              , focus should be primarily on your diet. Once you
              plateau, you can then add in additional cardio as a
              means to increase your progress. Again, it might
              not even be necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often times, people buy-in to cardio being
              necessary for body composition. However, it’s more
              important for general health purposes than anything
              else and can actually negatively impact your
              ability to make progress in the gym depending on
              the form of cardio you choose to do, the intensity
              you perform it at, and your ability to recover.
            </p>
            <h4>12. How can a beginner build muscle?</h4>
            <p>
              By being consistent with their training, focusing
              on hitting each muscle group at least 2 times a
              week with an appropriate volume and weight for
              their abilities, and by progressing the weight used
              from workout to workout whenever possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be consistent. Train hard. Progress the weight.
            </p>
            <p>
              It takes time and it takes effort, but the process
              itself is pretty simple.
            </p>
            <h4>13. How many days a week should I work out?</h4>
            <p>
              How many days per week do you have available to
              work out? That is the more important question to
              answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally, to see progress 2-4 workouts are needed.
              3-4 workouts per week is the sweet spot. You can
              train more frequently depending on your goals and
              experience level. However, at least 2 days of
              resistance training per week is needed to see
              muscle growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that being said, during your training days, it
              is beneficial to perform full body workouts (2-3
              training days per week) or upper/lower workouts (4
              days per week). This will allow you to train with
              an optimal frequency to build or maintain lean body
              mass.
            </p>
            <h4>14. What is a good 5 day workout routine?</h4>
            <p>
              A good 5 day workout routine would be an
              upper/lower workout or push/pull/legs workout
              performed in a rotating training day fashion. You
              could also do an upper/lower or push/pull split
              with a “weaknesses” day as your 5th training day in
              the week.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’d recommend avoiding the traditional body part
              split if optimizing your training is your goal.
              However, they can still be useful if you’re simply
              working out for pure enjoyment purposes.

            <p>
              Building muscle takes time and consistency. Nothing
              will get you there fast(er) than your body is
              naturally able to through optimized training,
              nutrition and lifestyle habits.
            </p>

              There are certainly supplements than can help you

              can help improve performance and can help you build
              muscle more efficiently if you struggle to get it
              through your diet as well. And, of course, water is
              the driver of all things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Focus on getting your diet, workouts, and lifestyle
              under control and supplement as needed. That is
              what will help you build muscle optimally.

              16. Is it better to do a full body workout every
              day?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Certain advanced bodybuilders can benefit from full
              body workouts 6 times per week. However, it’s not a
              common practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Performing full body workouts every day might not
              be harmful depending on how you structure your
              training and the intensity in which you train with
              from session to session.
            </p>
            <p>
              For most though, it would be recommended to perform
              full body workouts 3-4 times per week. This would
              be more optimal for the larger portion of
              recreational lifters.

              muscle?

            <p>
              A minimum of 2 days of full body training with{" "}

            </p>
            <p>
              3 full body days is better. And once you get into
              the 4 training days per week, you begin reaching
              optimal training frequency and volume for the vast
              majority of lifters.
            </p>
            <p>
              There’s no perfect split for everyone. But most
              will benefit from an upper/lower workout split 4
              days per week. This is the general gold standard
              for building muscle for most.
            </p>
            <h4>18. Is it OK to lift weights every day?</h4>
            <p>
              Depending on what you’re doing and how you
              structure your training, it certainly can be.
            </p>
            <p>
              Weight lifting every single day for most is going
              to be completely unnecessary. Training with high
              intensity every day of the week will get you
              injured and burnt out pretty quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Find a good 3-5 day per week weight training
              program that is well thought out with an
              appropriate volume and split and stick to it.
              Instead of chasing workouts, chase progressions.
              Try to improve your lifts in some way. This is
              going to help you out a lot more in the long run.
            </p>
            <h4>19. Is exercising every day bad?</h4>
            <p>
              Not at all depending on how you go about things.
              Plenty of people do some form of exercise every day
              of the week. But, you will want to consider a
              couple things.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, you’ll want to stick to a resistance
              training plan if your goal is specific. You’ll want
              it to be the main focus of your training. Any other
              form of exercise centers around it. As mentioned,
              optimally for most recreational lifters will be 3-5
              days per week.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other days, you’ll want to ensure that
              whatever form of exercise you select doesn’t take
              away from your ability to{" "}
              <a href="/expert-guides/workout-recovery">
                recover
              </a>{" "}
              or push yourself during your main weight training
              sessions. Good forms of exercise will be
              recreational sports, walking, yoga, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              What you don’t want to do is combine your weight
              training programs with another activity that is
              also very high intensity. The two will be
              counterproductive to one another.
            </p>
            <h4>20. Is it bad to go to the gym every day?</h4>
            <p>
              It depends on what you are doing while you are at
              the gym. You have to give your body time to recover
              if you want to grow, so if you are training
              intensely every single day, then it’s not ideal.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are going to the gym out of habit every day,
              but not weight lifting, it may be ok. If some of
              your sessions are split between cardio, mobility
              work, and weight training – then, it might truly be
              fine.
            </p>
            <p>
              All that being said, unless you’re a competitive
              athlete, it’s highly unnecessary to go to the gym
              every day. You might want to consider other hobbies
              that aren’t necessarily related just to round
              yourself out as a human being.
            </p>
            <p>
              Going to the gym every day as a recreational lifter
              can lead to some obsessive habits that aren’t
              healthy. Focus on 3-5 days and spend your valuable
              time pursuing other priorities in life.
            </p>
            <h4>21. What should I do on rest days?</h4>
            <p>
              Rest on your rest days. Eat in a way that is
              consistent with your goals and focus on recovering
              from your training sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also do something that is known as active
              recovery. Active recovery can be performed in a
              number of ways but is a light activity that gets
              your blood flowing, isn’t stressful, and helps you
              recover.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some examples of active recovery include recovery
              walks, yoga, and mobility work.

            <p>
              Selecting the right workout routine is crucial for
              reaching your goals. People who don't choose the
              right plan are setting themselves up for failure.
              Here are our top 8 tips for selecting a workout.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Select a workout routine that's designed for your
                experience level. Seems simple right? Many people
                who are just getting started lifting still choose
                workout plans that are designed for experienced
                lifters and pro bodybuilders. You will get much
                faster results from a plan that suits your
                experience. If you're just starting out, find a{" "}

                .

              <li>
                Be clear about your goals. When we polled our
                readers and asked their main goal the highest
                response was “build muscle and lose fat". Unless
                you're a beginner or taking steroids, this is
                extremely hard to achieve. Think about your goal
                before selecting a workout routine. Do you want
                to build muscle or lose fat first? Do you want to
                improve your sports performance? Do you want to
                increase endurance? The clearer you are about
                your goal the easier it is going to be to find
                the right plan and the better your results will
                be.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                Think about your lifestyle and select a workout
                that fits. Don't try and fit a 5-6 day workout
                routine into your already busy lifestyle. You'll
                skip days, not recover properly and ultimately
                fail. You would have been better off with a
                workout plan that only requires 3 days in the
                gym. Think about how much time you can
                realistically put in working out.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                Choose a workout routine you know you'll be able
                to stick with for the full duration. Most workout
                plans are designed for a set period. 8-10 weeks
                for example. You're not going to get the best
                results if you only follow the routine for 4-5
                weeks. This is something you should definitely
                look out for in periodization routines as the
                workload often increases as you progress through
                the workout.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                Know your{" "}
                <a href="/articles/body-types-ectomorph-mesomorph-endomorph.html">
                  body type
                </a>{" "}
                before selecting a workout plan. Most new lifters
                don't understand how body types affect results.
                For example, a 6'2" man with a thin build often
                gets totally different results from the same
                workout than a 5'5" heavy set man. It's important
                you understand your own body type and what
                workout to use to maximize results.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                Have realistic expectations. You've seen the
                magazine covers and fitness models on social
                media. Don't expect these results in the first 3
                months of training. If you set your expectations
                too high you're bound to lose motivation and give
                up. These people have often been working out for
                over 10 years and do this as a full time job. So
                set small goals for improving your physique and
                don't compare to others.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                Pick a plan you can do with a workout partner.
                Motivation is key to long term results in all
                aspects of fitness. Training with a partner is
                awesome. Workouts are more fun and you can keep
                each other motivated. Choose a workout partner
                that is slightly better than you. Meaning, if
                your goal is fat loss, they're slightly leaner.
                If your goal is muscle building then they're
                slightly bigger and stronger. This will bring out
                your competitive spirit as you try and match them
                when you're training.
