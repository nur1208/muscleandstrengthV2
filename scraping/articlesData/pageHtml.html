                      <p>
                        The best routine for the gym is one that
                        is flexible with your schedule and you
                        actually enjoy. These two factors will
                        contribute greatly to your ability to be
                        consistent with your workouts.
                        Consistency with your workouts and
                        progressing as you perform them is what
                        will lead to results.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        That being said, there are plenty of
                        great workout program styles one can do
                        to build muscle, lose fat, or

                          >build strength</a
                        >. The body composition goals (building
                        muscle and losing fat) will be
                        accomplished through similar style
                        workouts combined with differing
                        nutritional principles, while those
                        looking for strength gains may need to
                        focus on programs that are centered on
                        the idea of specificity.

                        To sum that statement up, if you want to
                        change your body composition, you’ll want
                        to train with volume. If you want to
                        build strength, you’ll want a program
                        that is strength specific for the lifts
                        you want to improve such as the bench
                        press, squat and deadlift.

                      <p>
                        The answer to this question would assume
                        that the person asking is referring to
                        body part splits. In this case, the way
                        you split your days likely won’t matter
                        too much, as long as you work every body
                        part throughout the week.

                      <p>
                        There may be some benefit into ensuring
                        you don’t hit chest and shoulders or legs
                        and back on consecutive days, but if you
                        do, it probably won’t be that big of an
                        issue depending on your overall strength
                        levels.

                        throughout the week), you may want to
                        look into pairing certain muscle groups
                        on certain workout days.

                        The most popular pairings are full body
                        workouts, upper/lower workouts, push/pull

                        of a difference to the overall outcome of
                        your training so long as you are

                        3. What should a beginner do at the gym?
                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        The best thing a beginner can do at the
                        gym is seek out the help of a trained
                        professional to assist them with learning
                        the proper form of each exercise.
                        Practicing the basics and establishing a
                        solid foundation in terms of form will
                        help a beginner lifter remain injury free
                        throughout their life.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you are not in the position to hire a
                        trained professional, you may want to
                        proceed working out with some level of
                        caution. The same recommendation of
                        practicing the fundamentals still
                        applies. Start off with light weight (the
                        bar on barbell exercises) and record
                        yourself performing exercises.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        With the exercise recordings, compare
                        your form with examples of proper form.
                        Evaluate how you are moving and progress
                        from there by either working on your
                        form, or after you’ve mastered your form,
                        adding weight.

                        The best workout routine for true

                        start off performing anywhere between 2-4
                        workouts per week. These workouts can be

                        The workouts should focus on learning
                        ideal movement patterns of fundamental
                        lifts such as horizontal presses,

                        not be the best 10 exercise for another
                        person. When selecting an exercise to
                        use, it’s important to keep your own
                        abilities and goals in mind. Some people
                        might be able to perform an exercise with
                        no pain at all, while that same exercise
                        might cause another a lot of pain. If it
                        hurts, don’t do it and find an
                        alternative.

                        workout makes sense. 3 days? Full body
                        makes sense, push/pull/legs can work as
                        well if that is what you enjoy. The more

                        regularly. Then, look to schedule your
                        training on those days. Find a workout
                        that doesn’t require any more than that
                        total training frequency. Then, look for
                        something where if you miss a training
                        day, you’re able to make it up throughout
                        the week or already train that muscle
                        more than once per week.

                      <p>
                        10 pounds in a month is likely during a
                        lean bulking phase, especially for
                        beginners. The muscle will grow fairly
                        quickly, and if you’re coming off a fat
                        loss phase, early weight gain will be
                        from glycogen replenishing and being
                        stored in the body.

                        Cardio recommendations will be highly
                        dependent on your overall goal. For most,
                        it may not be even necessary to perform
                        additional cardio. Focusing on
                        progressing the weight used in your
                        workouts and getting stronger over time
                        will have a more beneficial impact on
                        your body composition than cardio will.

                        Generally, to see progress 2-4 workouts
                        are needed. 3-4 workouts per week is the
                        sweet spot. You can train more frequently
                        depending on your goals and experience
                        level. However, at least 2 days of

                        see muscle growth.

                        perform full body workouts (2-3 training

                      <p>
                        A good 5 day workout routine would be an

                        workout performed in a rotating training
                        day fashion. You could also do an
                        upper/lower or push/pull split with a
                        “weaknesses” day as your 5th training day
                        in the week.

                        weight training programs with another
                        activity that is also very high
                        intensity. The two will be
                        counterproductive to one another.

                        20. Is it bad to go to the gym every day?
                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        It depends on what you are doing while
                        you are at the gym. You have to give your
                        body time to recover if you want to grow,
                        so if you are training intensely every
                        single day, then it’s not ideal.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you are going to the gym out of habit
                        every day, but not weight lifting, it may
                        be ok. If some of your sessions are split
                        between cardio, mobility work, and weight
                        training – then, it might truly be fine.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        All that being said, unless you’re a
                        competitive athlete, it’s highly
                        unnecessary to go to the gym every day.
                        You might want to consider other hobbies
                        that aren’t necessarily related just to
                        round yourself out as a human being.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Going to the gym every day as a
                        recreational lifter can lead to some
                        obsessive habits that aren’t healthy.
                        Focus on 3-5 days and spend your valuable
                        time pursuing other priorities in life.

                      <h4>21. What should I do on rest days?</h4>
                      <p>
                        Rest on your rest days. Eat in a way that
                        is consistent with your goals and focus
                        on recovering from your training
                        sessions.

                        You can also do something that is known
                        as active recovery. Active recovery can
                        be performed in a number of ways but is a
                        light activity that gets your blood
                        flowing, isn’t stressful, and helps you
                        recover.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Some examples of active recovery include
                        recovery walks, yoga, and mobility work.

                        Workout Selection Tips

                      <p>
                        Selecting the right workout routine is
                        crucial for reaching your goals. People
                        who don't choose the right plan are
                        setting themselves up for failure. Here
                        are our top 8 tips for selecting a
                        workout.

                          Select a workout routine that's
                          designed for your experience level.
                          Seems simple right? Many people who are
                          just getting started lifting still
                          choose workout plans that are designed
                          for experienced lifters and pro
                          bodybuilders. You will get much faster
                          results from a plan that suits your
                          experience. If you're just starting
                          out, find a
                          <a href="/workouts/beginner"
                            >beginner workout</a
                          >.

                          Be clear about your goals. When we
                          polled our readers and asked their main
                          goal the highest response was “build
                          muscle and lose fat". Unless you're a
                          beginner or taking steroids, this is
                          extremely hard to achieve. Think about
                          your goal before selecting a workout
                          routine. Do you want to build muscle or
                          lose fat first? Do you want to improve
                          your sports performance? Do you want to
                          increase endurance? The clearer you are
                          about your goal the easier it is going
                          to be to find the right plan and the
                          better your results will be.

                        <li>
                          Think about your lifestyle and select a
                          workout that fits. Don't try and fit a
                          5-6 day workout routine into your
                          already busy lifestyle. You'll skip
                          days, not recover properly and
                          ultimately fail. You would have been
                          better off with a workout plan that
                          only requires 3 days in the gym. Think
                          about how much time you can
                          realistically put in working out.

                        <li>
                          Choose a workout routine you know
                          you'll be able to stick with for the
                          full duration. Most workout plans are
                          designed for a set period. 8-10 weeks
                          for example. You're not going to get
                          the best results if you only follow the
                          routine for 4-5 weeks. This is
                          something you should definitely look
                          out for in periodization routines as
                          the workload often increases as you
                          progress through the workout.

                          >
                          before selecting a workout plan. Most
                          new lifters don't understand how body
                          types affect results. For example, a
                          6'2" man with a thin build often gets
                          totally different results from the same
                          workout than a 5'5" heavy set man. It's
                          important you understand your own body
                          type and what workout to use to
                          maximize results.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          Have realistic expectations. You've
                          seen the magazine covers and fitness
                          models on social media. Don't expect
                          these results in the first 3 months of
                          training. If you set your expectations
                          too high you're bound to lose
                          motivation and give up. These people
                          have often been working out for over 10
                          years and do this as a full time job.
                          So set small goals for improving your
                          physique and don't compare to others.

                        <li>
                          Pick a plan you can do with a workout
                          partner. Motivation is key to long term
                          results in all aspects of fitness.
                          Training with a partner is awesome.
                          Workouts are more fun and you can keep
                          each other motivated. Choose a workout
                          partner that is slightly better than
                          you. Meaning, if your goal is fat loss,
                          they're slightly leaner. If your goal
                          is muscle building then they're
                          slightly bigger and stronger. This will
                          bring out your competitive spirit as
                          you try and match them when you're
                          training.
